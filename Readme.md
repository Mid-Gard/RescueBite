RescueBite is a web application aimed at combating food wastage in hotels by facilitating the efficient distribution of excess food to those in need. The project connects hotels and willing organizations (NGOs, community groups, etc.) to ensure surplus food is redirected to orphanages, shelters, and individuals facing food scarcity.

## Key Features

- **Donor and Distributor Registration:** Hotels and other donors can easily register on the platform, as well as NGOs and distributors interested in receiving and distributing surplus food.

- **Food Redistribution:** Donors can post details about available surplus food, specifying quantity, type, and location. Distributors can then access this information and coordinate the collection and distribution process.

- **Web Application:** RescueBite features a user-friendly web application developed using React for the frontend, ensuring a smooth and intuitive experience for both donors and distributors.

- **Backend and Database:** The backend is powered by Flask, a lightweight Python web framework, and utilizes an SQLite database to manage data efficiently.
